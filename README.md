# Angular-Learning
This is my Angular trial project.

To run it, you need to install the following packages for BackEnd:
<br>Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer
Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design
Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools
And you need to install node_modules for FrontEnd:
npm install --save (In terminal)
